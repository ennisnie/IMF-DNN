# IMF-DNN

Integrated Multimodality Deep Fusion Deep Neural Network (IMF-DNN), which can flexibly accomplish both object detection and end-to-end tasks. The key of our approach is to process each modality independently with its own networks meanwhile to integrate these networks using additional central networks. This character makes our IMF-DNN flexible and able to accomplish both modular pipeline and end-to-end tasks. 

Extensive experiments demonstrate the test strategy to systematically analyze DNNs robustness and generalization ability in large amounts of diverse driving environment conditions We hope it will become useful resources for the intelligent vehicles research community.
