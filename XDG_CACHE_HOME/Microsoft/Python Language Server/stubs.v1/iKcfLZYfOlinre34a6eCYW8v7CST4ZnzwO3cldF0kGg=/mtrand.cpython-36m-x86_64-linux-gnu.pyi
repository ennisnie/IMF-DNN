def multinomial():
    '\n        multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)\n\n        Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.\n\n        The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the\n        binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``\n        possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,\n        where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the\n        distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,\n        ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the\n        outcome was ``i``.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        n : int\n            Number of experiments.\n        pvals : sequence of floats, length p\n            Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These\n            should sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to\n            account for the remaining probability, as long as\n            ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a\n            single value is returned.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray\n            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,\n            the shape is ``(N,)``.\n\n            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional\n            value drawn from the distribution.\n\n        Examples\n        --------\n        Throw a dice 20 times:\n\n        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)\n        array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])\n\n        It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.\n\n        Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:\n\n        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)\n        array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],\n               [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])\n\n        For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,\n        we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.\n\n        A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:\n\n        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])\n        array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26])\n\n        The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation\n        detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take\n        up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.\n        A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the\n        other should be sampled like so:\n\n        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT\n        array([38, 62])\n\n        not like:\n\n        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG\n        array([100,   0])\n\n        '

def multivariate_normal():
    '\n        multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, size, check_valid, tol])\n\n        Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.\n\n        The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a\n        generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher\n        dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and\n        covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean\n        (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"\n        squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        mean : 1-D array_like, of length N\n            Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.\n        cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)\n            Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and\n            positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are\n            generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because\n            each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.\n            If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.\n        check_valid : { \'warn\', \'raise\', \'ignore\' }, optional\n            Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.\n        tol : float, optional\n            Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray\n            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.

This is\n        analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or\n        univariate normal distribution.\n\n        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.\n        From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional\n        samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix\n        element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.\n        The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its\n        "spread").\n\n        Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular\n        approximations include:\n\n          - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)\n          - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on\n            the diagonal)\n\n        This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting\n        generated data-points:\n\n        >>> mean = [0, 0]\n        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance\n\n        Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:\n\n        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n        >>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T\n        >>> plt.plot(x, y, \'x\')\n        >>> plt.axis(\'equal\')\n        >>> plt.show()\n\n        Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.\n        nonnegative-definite).

The classical Pareto distribution can be\n        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and\n        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The\n        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the\n        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard\n        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also\n        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized\n        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set\n        to one and the location set to zero.\n\n        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is\n        unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In\n        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest\n        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the\n        remaining 80 percent of the range.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Shape of the distribution.

Outside the field of\n        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford\n        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe\n        the distribution of wealth in an economy.

def zipf():
    '\n        zipf(a, size=None)\n\n        Draw samples from a Zipf distribution.\n\n        Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter\n        `a` > 1.\n\n        The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a\n        continuous probability distribution that satisfies Zipf\'s law: the\n        frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a\n        frequency table.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Distribution parameter. Should be greater than 1.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar. Otherwise,\n            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized Zipf distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        scipy.stats.zipf : probability density function, distribution, or\n            cumulative density function, etc.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density for the Zipf distribution is\n\n        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{x^{-a}}{\\zeta(a)},\n\n        where :math:`\\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta function.\n\n        It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted\n        that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely\n        proportional to its rank in the frequency table.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..
